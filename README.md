# Fromdocs for Java

Fromdocs is a library that allows extracting identification data from digital copies of some identification documents emited in Mozambique. The extracted data can be used to automate the completion of electronic forms and, with that the process becomes faster and less error prone.

Currently the set of documents supported by FromDocs include ID, NUIT, Passport and Driving license. The copies can be presented in PDF, JPG or PNG file formats.

## Features

## Usage

DocumentReader reader  = new DocumentReader("/path/docfile.pdf", "NUIT");

String number = document.getNumber();
String lastName = document.getLastName();
String givenNames = document.getGivenNames();
LocalDate birthdate = document.getBirthdate();
String placeBirth = document.getPlaceBirth();
LocalDate dateIssue = document.getDateIssue();
```
